                After his school, he had to fight the conventional mindset. Especially his Grand Mother to join Hotel

                will, neither could his son get into a Medical College or an Engineering College. Thanks to the average
                marks he scored.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hotel Management course helped him to get into the Hotel Industry. 25 years ago he made the entry into
                Casino Group of Hotels (Now CGH Earth). It was a humble beginning as Asst. Lobby Manager. He was at the
                right time at the right place. CGH Earth was growing rapidly and so was Kerala Tourism. He took
                advantage of both and that’s how he is in his position now as Vice President of the organization.

                </a></h3>
              <p>
                Shoba George is the Founder of The Extra Mile , a Boutique Luxury experiential travel company based in
                Pune, with almost 20 years of experience in the travel industry.

                I started my career in the apparent export  industry . My love for travel and deep understanding of art
                and culture of South India , prompted me to start "Kerala Wish us" a boutique travel company offering
                immersive and cultural travel experience in South India. My background as a student of Fine Arts helped
                me curate experiences that help clients really engage in the beautiful temples , the art forms and the
                history and heritage of the destination.
                I can say I grew with my clients, every client came back for new destinations, and slowly we moved from
                only planing tours in South India to planning tours around the world. So in 2008, I set up The Extra
                Mile.
                We carefully choose  to remain small, so that we could continue to deliver unique and tailor made
                holidays for our clients. We were one of the first travel companies in India to be invited as a buyer to
                the Experiential travel show Pure Life Experience. Here I expanded my network with the best of
                experiential travel providers from around the world. With this excellent network , we have been able to
                consistantly deliver bespoke and unique travel experiences to our clients. We  continue to spend a good
                part of our time in research and development and growing our network with amazing people from every walk
                of life , historians, art curators, culinary experts, archeologists , textile experts, naturalists ,
                film makers, writers, designers  and more who share their knowledge of their areas of expertise  with
                our guest. 
                Over the years we have never advertised , we have purely grown by word of mouth. We now have HNI clients
                from all over the world .
                Clients stay with us as they have the  confidence in our understanding of their expectations, and in our
                uncanny ability to design tours that meet beyond their expectations.

              <p>
                The Post-Graduation  programme in Tourism Administration from Christ University, Bangalore gave an
                excellent introduction to the sights and sounds of our motherland, India. In the span of  2 years of the
                Masters’ programme, we were lucky enough to cover almost all the touristic destinations and varied
                experiences that our country has to offer.

                From that days, the diversity of India which is unparalleled to any other country in the globe
                fascinated me.
                Since I was always a peoples person, I didn’t have to think twice to choose Sales as my profession
                ahead.

                Starting my sales career with a conference management firm at Bangalore which gave strong impetus into
                the domestic corporate world and their functionalities, this was also a learning phase on how to manage
                varied groups as I had a dual role of a tour escort too accompanying these corporate groups. The
                Bangalore life lasted for almost 2 years and by then I had visited India’s 365 day destination, Goa,
                more than a dozen times as this was the hotspot for corporates to unwind !!

                Come 2006, my innings with CGH Earth Hotels started as a Sales Executive – Domestic Market.
                For the last 14 odd years, this wonderful journey still continues and I love to keep the same passion
                and enthusiasm in interacting with my fellow Indians-be it trade partners or corporates - in my present
                role as Senior Sales Manager taking care of the Indian market.

                The Big Fat Indian Market is very close to my heart and I would love to share as many stories and
                experiences associated with the domestic market.
